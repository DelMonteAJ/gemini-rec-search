What is GPT?

Generative Pre-trained Transformers, commonly known as GPT, are a family of neural network models that uses the transformer architecture and is a key advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) powering generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. GPT models give applications the ability to create human-like text and content (images, music, and more), and answer questions in a conversational manner. Organizations across industries are using GPT models and generative AI for Q&A bots, text summarization, content generation, and search.

Why is GPT important?

The GPT models, and in particular, the transformer architecture that they use, represent a significant AI research breakthrough. The rise of GPT models is an inflection point in the widespread adoption of ML because the technology can be used now to automate and improve a wide set of tasks ranging from language translation and document summarization to writing blog posts, building websites, designing visuals, making animations, writing code, ]researching complex topics, and even composing poems. The value of these models lies in their speed and the scale at which they can operate. For example, where you might need several hours to research, write, and edit an article on nuclear physics, a GPT model can produce one in seconds. GPT models have sparked the research in AI towards achieving artificial general intelligence, which means machines can help organizations reach new levels of productivity and reinvent their applications and customer experiences.

What are the use cases of GPT?

The GPT models are general-purpose language models that can perform a broad range of tasks from creating original content to write code, summarizing text, and extracting data from documents.

Here are some ways you can use the GPT models:

Create social media content

Digital marketers, assisted by artificial intelligence (AI), can create content for their social media campaigns. For example, marketers can prompt a GPT model to produce an explainer video script. GPT-powered image processing software can create memes, videos, marketing copy, and other content from text instructions.

Convert text to different styles

GPT models generate text in casual, humorous, professional, and other styles. The models allow business professionals to rewrite a particular text in a different form. For example, lawyers can use a GPT model to turn legal copies into simple explanatory notes. 

Write and learn code

As language models, the GPT models can understand and write computer code in different programming languages. The models can help learners by explaining computer programs to them in everyday language. Also, experienced developers can use GPT tools to autosuggest relevant code snippets.

Analyze data

The GPT model can help business analysts efficiently compile large volumes of data. The language models search for the required data and calculate and display the results in a data table or spreadsheet. Some applications can plot the results on a chart or create comprehensive reports. 

Produce learning materials

Educators can use GPT-based software to generate learning materials such as quizzes and tutorials. Similarly, they can use GPT models to evaluate the answers.

Build interactive voice assistants

The GPT models allow you to build intelligent interactive voice assistants. While many chatbots only respond to basic verbal prompts, the GPT models can produce chatbots with conversational AI capabilities. In addition, these chatbots can converse verbally like humans when paired with other AI technologies. 

How does GPT work?

Though it’s accurate to describe the GPT models as artificial intelligence (AI), this is a broad description. More specifically, the GPT models are neural network-based language prediction models built on the Transformer architecture. They analyze natural language qu
